## Problem Statement

Create a public github/gitlab repository for this project

Create a page that would have a banner slider / carousel

One image should be displayed at a time, but should have 2 more images that would automatically slide from left to right at 1 second

You may use any language/framework to produce the banner and data source itself as long as you are not using a specific library that produces a carousel/banner like https://glidejs.com/

You may use any HTML element/structure as long as it follows the HTML5 standards

The images and data must come from an API/local data source

Feel free to choose from the available public APIs (https://scryfall.com/docs/api)

You can also create a simple API/web server that would serve the data to produce the banner slider

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

### `npm start`
